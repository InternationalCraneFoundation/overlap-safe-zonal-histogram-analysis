# Zonal Histogram Analysis Tool

A comprehensive Python tool for computing zonal histograms from classified rasters with complete class coverage. This tool ensures accurate per-zone statistics by processing each zone individually and including all possible habitat classes in the output.

## Tool Purpose

This repository contains the **zonal histogram analysis tool** - a Python script that computes accurate zonal histograms from classified rasters with complete class coverage.

**Key Achievement**: This tool solves the overlap artifacts problem found in many GIS zonal analysis tools by processing each zone individually rather than using bulk processing methods.

## Overview

This tool addresses common limitations of basic zonal statistics tools by:

- **Complete Class Coverage**: Includes ALL classes from the raster attribute table, even if not present in specific zones
- **Individual Zone Processing**: Processes each zone separately to prevent overlap artifacts
- **üéØ Overlapping Zone Support**: Handles overlapping buffer zones correctly (where other tools fail)
- **Robust Input Validation**: Handles coordinate system mismatches and validates file formats
- **Standalone Operation**: Works with open-source libraries, no ArcGIS license required

### **Why Overlapping Zone Support Matters**

Many ecological and environmental analyses use **overlapping buffer zones**:
- Multiple buffer distances around the same point (100m, 200m, 500m buffers)
- Adjacent study areas with overlapping boundaries
- Nested or hierarchical zone designs

**Problem with bulk processing**: Most GIS tools (including ArcGIS Pro's Zonal Histogram) process all zones simultaneously, causing overlap artifacts and incorrect pixel counts.

**Our solution**: Individual zone processing ensures each zone gets accurate, independent pixel counts regardless of overlaps with other zones.

## Current Repository Structure

The repository contains a clean, focused set of files:

```
README.md                          ‚Üê This documentation
pyproject.toml                     ‚Üê Modern Python project configuration (dependencies, metadata)
requirements.txt                   ‚Üê Legacy pip dependencies (for compatibility)
zonal_histogram_complete.py        ‚Üê ‚≠ê MAIN TOOL - Use this one!
ZonalHistogram.csv                 ‚Üê Example output from analysis
.venv/                             ‚Üê Virtual environment directory
```

**For new users: Use `uv sync` for automatic setup, or use `zonal_histogram_complete.py` with manual configuration.**

## Quick Start

### Standalone Python Setup (Only Option)

1. **Install UV Package Manager** (fastest Python environment manager):
   ```powershell
   # Install UV using pip
   pip install uv
   
   # Or download from: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv
   ```

2. **Set up project with automatic dependency management**:
   ```powershell
   # Clone or download this repository, then:
   cd path\to\ZH
   
   # Create virtual environment and install all dependencies automatically
   uv sync
   
   # Activate the environment (on Windows)
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   **Alternative (if you prefer requirements.txt)**:
   ```powershell
   # Manual approach
   uv venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure your file paths** in `zonal_histogram_complete.py`:
   ```python
   @classmethod
   def default(cls) -> HistogramConfig:
       return cls(
           raster_path=Path(r"path\to\your\classified_raster.tif"),
           zones_path=Path(r"path\to\your\zones_layer.shp"), 
           output_csv=Path("zonal_histogram_results.csv"),
           rat_field="class_description"  # or your attribute field name
       )
   ```
   
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **VERIFY**: Both files must use the SAME coordinate system!

4. **Run the analysis**:
   ```powershell
   python zonal_histogram_complete.py
   ```

   **Or use the installed command** (if using pyproject.toml):
   ```powershell
   zonal-histogram
   ```

## Modern Project Setup Benefits

This project now includes both traditional (`requirements.txt`) and modern (`pyproject.toml`) dependency management:

### **Using `pyproject.toml` (Recommended)**:
- ‚úÖ **Automatic setup**: `uv sync` handles everything
- ‚úÖ **Version locking**: Ensures reproducible environments
- ‚úÖ **Project metadata**: Proper package information
- ‚úÖ **Command installation**: `zonal-histogram` command available after setup

### **Using `requirements.txt` (Compatible)**:
- ‚úÖ **Familiar approach**: Traditional pip-style installation
- ‚úÖ **Broad compatibility**: Works with any Python environment manager
- ‚úÖ **Simple**: Just `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`

## File Requirements

### Input Files

1. **Classified Raster** (GeoTIFF format):
   - Must have a raster attribute table (VAT)
   - VAT should be in `.tif.vat.dbf` format
   - Contains classified data (land cover, habitat types, etc.)

2. **Zone Polygons** (Shapefile):
   - Polygon features defining analysis areas
   - Must use the SAME coordinate system as the raster (critical!)
   - Should have a unique identifier field

### Output

- **CSV file** with zonal histogram results
- Format: `[Zone_ID, Class1_Count, Class2_Count, ..., Total_Pixels]`
- One row per zone, one column per habitat class

## Coordinate System Requirements

‚ö†Ô∏è **ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL**: The raster and zones must use IDENTICAL coordinate systems.

This is the most important requirement for accurate results. **Mismatched coordinate systems will produce incorrect pixel counts and spatial errors.**

### Checking Coordinate Systems

Before running the analysis, verify both files use the same CRS:

```python
import geopandas as gpd
import rasterio

# Check raster CRS
with rasterio.open("your_raster.tif") as src:
    print(f"Raster CRS: {src.crs}")

# Check zones CRS  
zones = gpd.read_file("your_zones.shp")
print(f"Zones CRS: {zones.crs}")
```

### CRS Mismatch Warning

The script will display prominent warnings if coordinate systems don't match:
```
================================================================================
COORDINATE SYSTEM MISMATCH DETECTED!
Zone CRS: EPSG:4326 (WGS84)
Raster CRS: EPSG:3005 (NAD83 / BC Albers)
================================================================================
REPROJECTING zones to match raster coordinate system...
For best results, ensure both inputs use the same CRS from the start.
Automatic reprojection may introduce minor inaccuracies.
================================================================================
```

### Fixing CRS Mismatches

**Best Practice**: Reproject your data to match BEFORE running the analysis:

```python
# Option 1: Reproject zones to match raster
zones = gpd.read_file("zones.shp")
zones_reprojected = zones.to_crs("EPSG:3005")  # Match your raster CRS
zones_reprojected.to_file("zones_reprojected.shp")

# Option 2: Use GDAL to reproject raster
# gdalwarp -t_srs EPSG:4326 input.tif output_reprojected.tif
```

## Configuration Options

### HistogramConfig Class

The `HistogramConfig` class centralizes all analysis parameters:

```python
config = HistogramConfig(
    raster_path=Path("habitat_classified.tif"),
    zones_path=Path("buffer_zones.shp"),
    output_csv=Path("results.csv"),
    rat_field="cls_desc_2",        # Attribute table field with class names
    zones_field=None,              # Zone ID field (None = auto-detect)
    overwrite=False                # Overwrite existing output files
)
```

### Command Line Usage

```powershell
# Interactive mode (prompts for missing inputs)
python zonal_histogram_complete.py

# Specify all parameters
python zonal_histogram_complete.py \
    --raster habitat_map.tif \
    --zones study_areas.shp \
    --output results.csv \
    --rat-field habitat_type

# Get help
python zonal_histogram_complete.py --help
```

## How It Works

### Individual Zone Processing

Unlike bulk processing methods, this tool processes each zone separately:

1. **For each zone polygon**:
   - Create a temporary raster mask for just that zone
   - Extract raster pixels falling within the zone boundary
   - Count pixels for each habitat class
   - Record results with complete class coverage

2. **Benefits of individual processing**:
   - Prevents overlap artifacts between adjacent zones
   - Ensures accurate pixel counts that sum correctly
   - Avoids the overlap errors found in some GIS tools (including ArcGIS Pro's Zonal Histogram)
   - Guarantees complete class coverage for each zone

### Complete Class Coverage

The tool loads ALL possible classes from the raster attribute table:

```python
# Example output includes ALL classes, even with 0 pixels
Zone_ID, Coniferous_Forest, Deciduous_Forest, Grassland, Water, Urban, ...
Buffer_1, 1250, 0, 340, 0, 15, ...
Buffer_2, 890, 125, 0, 45, 0, ...
```

This ensures:
- Consistent column structure across all zones
- Easy data analysis and visualization
- No missing data issues from classes not present in specific zones

## Performance Notes

- **Processing Time**: ~30-60 seconds for 197 zones with a 30m resolution raster
- **Memory Usage**: Moderate (loads one zone at a time)
- **Accuracy**: Pixel counts are exact and match ArcGIS Pro results

## Testing

This project includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability and accuracy.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Raster attribute table not found"**
   - Check for `.tif.vat.dbf` file alongside your raster
   - Ensure the VAT was properly created during classification

2. **"Coordinate system mismatch"**
   - Reproject either the raster or zones to match coordinate systems
   - Use `gdalwarp` or ArcGIS to reproject data

3. **"No valid zones found"**
   - Check that zone polygons overlap with the raster extent
   - Verify zone geometries are valid (no self-intersections)

4. **Import errors with GeoPandas/Rasterio**
   - Make sure you activated the virtual environment: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Reinstall packages: `uv pip install --force-reinstall geopandas rasterio`

### Getting Help

1. **Check the log output** - the script provides detailed progress information
2. **Verify input files** - ensure both raster and zones are readable
3. **Test with a small subset** - try with a few zones first to verify setup

## Example Workflow

```python
from pathlib import Path
from zonal_histogram_complete import HistogramConfig, main

# Set up configuration
config = HistogramConfig(
    raster_path=Path("data/habitat_classified.tif"),
    zones_path=Path("data/buffer_zones.shp"),
    output_csv=Path("results/habitat_histogram.csv"),
    rat_field="cls_desc_2"
)

# Run analysis
main(config)

# Results will be saved to habitat_histogram.csv
```
